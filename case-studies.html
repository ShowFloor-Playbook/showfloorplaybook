                    <span>+35%</span>

                <h4>Case Study 1: Systemizing a Global Tech Sales Team</h4>
                
                <div class="details">
                    <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> A large, decentralized B2B tech sales organization was attending key industry shows but saw 70% of collected leads fail to move past the MQL stage. Their primary issue was inconsistent data capture and a lack of standardized qualification scripting on the show floor.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>The Playbook Solution:</strong> We engaged with the **Custom ShowFloor Blueprint** package, auditing their existing mobile CRM use and developing five concise, mandatory conversation frameworks linked directly to qualification fields. We provided on-site training to regional sales leaders to enforce system adherence.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>The Payoff:</strong> Within two major events, the team reported an unprecedented **35% increase in the SQL-to-Closed-Won conversion rate** of trade show leads, establishing the event team as a primary, measurable revenue driver.</p>

                <div class="key-stat">
                    <span>40 Hours</span>
                    <p>Time saved per rep in manual post-show data cleanup.</p>
                </div>
                <h4>Case Study 2: Efficiency in Life Sciences Lead Follow-up</h4>
                
                <div class="details">
                    <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> A growing Life Sciences firm was drowning in paper notes and unstructured CRM data post-show. Sales reps were spending two full weeks after each event on manual data entry and "chasing ghosts," leading to burnout and slow follow-up times.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>The Playbook Solution:</strong> Through the **Booth-to-Booth Foundations Workshop**, we implemented a streamlined mobile capture tool integrated with AI summarization features. This eliminated manual entry and established a 'Next Action' trigger directly upon exiting a booth, standardizing the follow-up timeline.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>The Payoff:</strong> The average time spent on post-show data cleanup and lead qualification was reduced by over **40 hours per rep per show**, resulting in the fastest recorded lead-to-opportunity conversion time for the company.</p>

                    <span>100%</span>
                    <p>Adherence to pre-show planning and post-show follow-up metrics.</p>
                </div>
                <h4>Case Study 3: Establishing Leadership Accountability</h4>
                
                <div class="details">
                    <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> A national B2B services provider struggled with sales leadership being unable to track show-floor performance or ensure reps were hitting target booths. The ROI was "invisible," creating friction between Sales and Marketing.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>The Playbook Solution:</strong> Utilizing the **Leadership Partner Program**, we instituted real-time location-based tracking (for internal review only), live coaching, and mandatory goal alignment in Phase 1. This created a transparent feedback loop for sales managers, tied directly to performance reviews.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>The Payoff:</strong> The company achieved **100% adherence** to the established planning and follow-up metrics, building a culture of accountability that transformed the trade show strategy from an event cost center into a reliable, measurable growth channel.</p>
