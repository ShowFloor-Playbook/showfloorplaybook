    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
        ShowFloor Playbook™ was created to solve one problem: trade show chaos.
    </p>

    <p>
        Too many brands walk into shows without alignment, without strategy, and without a 
        repeatable system. We provide clarity, structure, and tools that help teams hit their goals 
        every time — whether it's buyer meetings, lead capture, or booth execution.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Playbook is built on real-world industry experience, distilled into a simple, powerful, 
        scalable framework.
